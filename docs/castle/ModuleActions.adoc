== (modifiers)

`keyboard` and `mouse` actions including information about any modifier keys that may be active to coincide with the main event.

For modifier keys that have distinct left and right keys, both the general and specific forms are included.  Eg, if the left `shift` key is held during the event, both `shift` and `lshift` will be true in the action object.

`gui` means Command on mac, Windows on win.
