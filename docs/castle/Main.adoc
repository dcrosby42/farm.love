= Main

`main.lua` is the starting point of all https://love2d.org/[LÃ–VE] (or "love2d") games.

To make a game with Castle, your `main.lua` can be as simple as this:

.main.lua
[source,lua]
----
local Castle = require "vendor/castle/main"

Castle.module_name = "modules/mygame"
----

== Hook: Castle.onload

To do the kind of setup you would normally do in `function love.load()` in a normal love2 game, eg, set window size, resolution or fullscreen options), you implement the *Castle.onload* hook, and your program will normally look more like this:


.main.lua
[source,lua]
----
local Castle = require "vendor/castle/main"

Castle.module_name = "modules/mygame"

Castle.onload = function()
  love.window.setMode(1024, 768, {
    fullscreen = false,
    resizable = false,
    highdpi = false,
    -- minwidth = 400,
    -- minheight = 300,
  })
end
----
