= Castle Modules

A *Module* is the basic unit of game creation in Castle.  

They do three things:

- Initialize the world
- Calculate a _new_ version of the world
- Draw the world

The details of *world* are decided by the Module's internal programming.

== Root Module

Your "root" Module is whichever module your game loads with.  (Many games will consist of a single Module, that's ok).

== Actions

== The 3 Module functions

=== newWorld() -> world

=== updateWorld(world, action) -> world

=== drawWorld(world)

== Advanced
=== Side Effects
=== Module Composition
=== Switcher Module
=== ECS Modules
